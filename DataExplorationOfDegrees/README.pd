Here I use Pandas to answer the following questions from data given in 'salaries_by_college_major.csv':



Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 

Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?

Which degrees have the highest earning potential?

What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?

Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?
