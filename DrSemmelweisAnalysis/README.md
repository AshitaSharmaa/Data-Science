EFFECT OF HANDWASING IN 1800:

In the past, people didn't know about bacteria, germs, or viruses. People illness was caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. 
But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and making arguments based on data. 
Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. 
Dr Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever
The dataset given by Dr Semmelweis covers the years 1841 to 1849. 
The two tables report the total number of births and the total number of deaths. 
Interestingly, the yearly data breaks the number of birthds and deaths down by clinic.
What we see is that something happened after 1847 i,e. Handwashing was made complusory.
The total number of deaths seems to have dropped, despite an increasing number of births!
