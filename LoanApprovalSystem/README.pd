## Problem Statement ##

A mid-sized financial company offers personal and home loans to customers across urban and rural regions of India.
Everyday,hundreds of customers apply for loans through online and branch applications. 
The bank faces two major challenges:
1. Good customers sometimes get rejected, Leading to loss of business.
2. High-risk customers sometimes get approved leading to financial losses.
To solve this problem, the bank wants to introduce an intelligent loan approval system powered by Machine Learning that can automatically 
analyse applicant details and predict whether a loan should be Approved or Rejected before final human verification.

## Solution ##

Each row in the dataset represents a loan applicant and contains multiple attributes describing their personal,financial, and credit information.

1> Seperate Categorical and Numerical Columns to handle missing values.
2> Check how balance classes are as its a classification problem either loan will be approved or not approved. After EDA it has been found that 
   29.8% applications were approved while 70.2% application were disapproved. Then check for every column leading to an important finding that
   high credit score increases the chances of loan approval. Then do outlier detection using box plot and found that there was no outlier in the data.
3> Performed feature engineering by encoding categorical columns using Label Encoder and One Hot Encoder.
4> Correlation Heatmapping ( Visual representation of the relationship between numerical variables in a dataset)was performed.
5> Split data in training and testing data. Scaling is performed.
6> Build different Models and Evaluate the metrics. Precision Score is taken mainly into consideration as we are more concerned 
   about False Positives i.e. High-risk customers should not get approved. 
7> Feature engineering is again performed to intensify the impact of the columns that are meaningful to the output and mute some of the columns.
   Model evaluation is performed again which indicates that Naive Bayes Model perform best for this data.
