SmartCart is a growing e-commerce platform serving customers across multiple countries. The company collected extensive customer data 
consisting of 2240 customer records and 22 attributes including demographics, purchase behaviour, website activity, and response.

Currently, SmartCart uses generic marketing and engagement strategies for all customers, without clearly understanding different customer behaviour patterns.
This results in inefficient marketing, missed opportunities to retain high-value customers, and delayed identification of churn-prone 
users. To solve this, SmartCart aims to build an intelligent customer segmentation system using unsupervised machine learning. 
The system will analyse historical customer transaction data and group customers into meaningful clusters based on purchasing behaviour, engagement levels, and loyalty indicators.

As an AI/ML Engineer to develop this system using clustering algorithms to discover hidden patterns in customer behaviour and support
data-driven decision-making for personalised marketing and customer retention.
